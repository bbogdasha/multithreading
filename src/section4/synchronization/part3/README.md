# DeadLock

Reciprocal locking is a situation where two or more threads are permanently locked, waiting for each other.

Avoid nested locking. If you have multiple objects you are trying to lock, make sure you lock them in the same order in all threads.

As a result of this program (with the first method), we get approximately the following result:

```java
DeadThreadOne is holding LOCK 1...
DeadThreadTwo is holding LOCK 2...
DeadThreadOne is waiting for Lock 2...
DeadThreadOne is waiting for Lock 1...
```

The program will stay in this state until it is manually stopped, because the two threads are waiting for each other to continue their work.

To avoid such a situation we will apply the second method:

```java
ThreadOne is holding lock 1...
ThreadOne is waiting for lock 2...
ThreadOne is holding lock 1 & 2...
ThreadTwo is holding lock 1...
ThreadOne is waiting for lock 2......
ThreadTwo is holding lock 1 & 2...
```
